# Command Line

Ringo comes with a command line tool `ringo` for running scripts and work with an interactive shell.

## Running Command Line Scripts

Writing command line scripts with Ringo is straightforward. To make a script work both as a command and as a module you can use the following boilerplate code. 
    
    function main(args) {
        // your code
    }

    // is this the main module executed?
    if (require.main === module) {
        main(system.args);
    }

This will call function `main` only if the script is run as a command line script. Otherwise it will act like an ordinary module. The `require`, `module`, and `system` objects used in this piece of code are provided by Ringo.

The command line scripts bundled with Ringo may also serve as a learning aid.

### Modules of particular interest for command line applications

  * [fs](/api/master/fs/) &ndash; filesystem manipulation
  * [system](/api/master/system/)
  * [ringo/args](/api/master/ringo/args/) &ndash; parser for command line options
  * [ringo/term](/api/master/ringo/term/) &ndash; ANSI terminal color and style
  * [ringo/scheduler](/api/master/ringo/scheduler/) &ndash; scheduling invocation of functions (threads)
  * [ringo/shell](/api/master/ringo/shell/) 
  * [ringo/subprocess](/api/master/ringo/subprocess/) &ndash; spawning processes

## Command Line Tools

Ringo comes with a number of command line tools. You can invoke all tools with the `-h` or `--help` flag to learn more about their options and arguments.

### ringo

`ringo` starts the Ringo runtime or shell. If called with one or more command line arguments it will try to run the first argument as script. If called without arguments, it starts an interactive shell (aka REPL).

The ringo command accepts a number of options. To learn more about them run ringo with the `-h` or `--help` switch. 

### ringo-web

`ringo-web` starts the Ringo web server. This command runs `ringo` with `ringo/httpserver` as main module. 

If an argument passed to `ringo-web` is interpreted as the path of the application to run. If the argument is a directory, it is assumed to contain a module called `config` exporting a [JSGI] app as `app`. If run without arguments, the application is assumed to be in the current working directory.

`ringo-web` takes a couple of options for things like setting the server port, host address, virtual host etc. By default ringo-web listens on port 8080.

### ringo-doc

`ringo-doc` is a tool to generate API documentation for a set of Ringo modules.

### ringo-admin

`ringo-admin` provides commands to create new Ringo applications or install Ringo packagers.

### Passing Java and Ringo options

In addition to the command specific options, all commands will pass any options prefixed by `-J` to the underlying java runtime. For example, use the folloging command to run ringo on the server HotSpot VM with a stack size of 64 kb:

    ringo -J-server -J-Xss64k

The app-specific commands (`ringo-web`, `ringo-doc`, `ringo-admin`) additionally pass all options prefixed with `-R` to the ringo command. For example, the following command will run `ringo-web` in debugger mode:

    ringo-web -R-d
