Start ringo with the `-d` option to start the graphical debugger. The debugger will break at the beginning of the main script. Set your breakpoints and click on the `Go` button to start running.

More info about the debugger can be found on the [Rhino wiki debugger page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino/Debugger).
