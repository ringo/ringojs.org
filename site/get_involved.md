## Submit Packages

You can upload your packages an [packages.ringojs.org](http://packages.ringojs.org), the Ringo package registry. If you already know `npm` from Node.js, it will be easy to use the `rpr` command-line tool to publish your Ringo modules and share them with other users. Please use semantic versioning for your packages to make dependency tracking easier.

## Contributing Code

To contribute a patch please fork the GitHub [ringojs repository] and push
your changes to your own tree. When you think your code is ready and stable
create a pull request in the main repository to have your changes merged.

Please make sure to only propose one feature or bug fix per pull request.
Mixing a lot of stuff into one pull request needlessly complicates and delays
handling.

Before pouring serious work into some new feature it may be a good idea
to let us know via the mailing list or on IRC. This way you avoid duplicating work or pouring
effort into something that has little chance to be accepted in the main tree.
