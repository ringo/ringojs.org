## About

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature available in Ringo. Instead, it walks you through the creation of a simple wiki and touches on the most important concepts and modules. Nonetheless the later sections of this tutorial are about more advanced topics like middleware authoring and java integration.

I assume you already have Ringo installed. See [Get Started](/get_started) if you need help with that.
