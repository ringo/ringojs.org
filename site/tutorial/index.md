About
---------

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature available in Ringo. Instead, it walks you through the creation of a simple wiki and touches on the most important concepts and modules. Nonetheless the later parts of this tutorial are certainly more advanced then the first few.

I assume you already have Ringo installed. See [Getting Started] if you need help with that.
